Dijjer is a peer-to-peer network. What distinguishes it from similar P2P tools like bittorrent is how easy it is to use for publishers and users. The publisher must simply prefix his url with http://127.0.0.1:9115/.

This extension adds a context menu item to dowload a ressource via dijjer if the webmaster did not prefix his url. This extension requires \[dijjer\](http://dijjer.org/) to be installed and running in order to work.

  My mouse has stopped to work. After a short diagnostic, I came to the conclusion that the wire cut. Unfortunately, you can't buy a simple wire. My new mouse will be wireless!
  How to make it work on Gentoo linux?

I just bought a new mouse. It is a nice Logitech MX900: very comfortable, and wireless (since the wire was the point of failure from my previous mouse). I was wondering whether it would work fine under Linux. Actually, it works better than expected.

When I plugged the mouse (actually, the base), it was automatically discovered and working fine. Even the wheel was behaving like expected. All this thanks to evdev: In the past, we had to use `xmodmap` or the `ButtonMapping` option in `/etc/X11/xorg.conf`.

However, my thumb buttons were not working. I like when thumb1 acts as a Â«Â backwardÂ Â» button in firefox and thumb2 as a Â«Â forwardÂ Â» button &#8212; that really ease navigation, I think. Once again, a [nice documentation came from Gentoo](http://planet.gentoo.org/developers/betelgeuse/2006/11/26/getting_mx_revolution_setup_in_gentoo).

But to make a long story short, the only thing I had to do was configure `/etc/X11/imwheel/imwheelrc` as follow
  
`".*"<br />
None, Thumb1, Alt_L|Left<br />
None, Thumb2, Alt_L|Right<br />
` 
  
And run `imwheel` &#8212; and not forget to publish this post before pressing thumb1 ðŸ˜‰

It can be fun to programm JavaME applications, but very expensive to do if you need to use wap every time to download your jar+jad files on your phone.

If you don&rsquo;t use wap, and send the jar+jad files with bluetooth, the flies appear in the « Other files » folder and there is nothing you can do with them (except deleting them 🙁 )

Well, that&rsquo;s before you unlock the java installation. Here is how to do it: On the phone homepage, type in the code \*#9998\*52824678255# (which reads \*#9998\*JAVAINSTALL# ). Your phone should display &lsquo;Activated&rsquo;.

Now, to install a new Java application:

  1. Transfer the jar and the jad on the phone (with bluetooth or usb cable)
  2. The two files appear in Files>Other files
  3. Double-click with the OK button on the jad

Cool, eh? 🙂

This is hardly credible, but yet real (bug [#932619](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/932619)). When you configure a MOSS to index <tt>http://server/home<b>P</b>age</tt>, it fails with 

> http://server/home**p**age The crawler could not communicate with the server. Check that the server is available and that the firewall access is configured correctly.

And indeed, SharePoint has changed the case, making every characters lower case.

We have just applied the SP1 which is supposed to fix this ridiculous bug. However, applying SP1 is not enough, [the system admin must also change the value of the registry key CaseSensitiveUrls to 1](http://sharepointsearch.com/cs/blogs/enterprisesearch/archive/2008/01/26/crawling-case-sensitive-web-content-in-sharepoint-server-2007-and-search-server-2008.aspx).

Since I use Gmail, I have little spam delivered into my inbox. Yet, for a couple of days, some spam manage to avoid the Gmail anti-spam.

  * Mrs amoussou requests my bank details to help to transfer $4.2 million. Of course, I would get some of it afterwards her my bank details
  * Heifner Imbach reads the bible for me, and inadvertently joins a virus as a devil gift
  * Conseils santé sells very cheap medicine
  * B2D1 thinks I should get ready for my email marketing campaign
  * and the list goes on…; Have spammers found a leak in [gmail anti-spam filter](http://www.google.com/mail/help/fightspam/spamexplained.html)?

I love the [Markdown syntax](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/). I think it the most readable when in plain text, hence it is very easy to write as well, plus it has a large feature set. It can be used for [writing blog posts](http://blogs.sonatype.com/people/jvanzyl/2008/10/19/blogging-in-markdown-with-embedded-code-syntax-highlighting/), for instance.

I am looking forward to writing my documentation in Markdown in Java projects managed with Maven, instead of using [APT](http://maven.apache.org/doxia/references/apt-format.html).

Do you know any maven-markdown-plugin? If not, is the [MarkdownJ implementation](https://sourceforge.net/projects/markdownj/) good (so that I can write the plugin myself)?

A document library may contain many draft documents (ie in a [minor version](http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/sharepointtechnology/HA100215761033.aspx)) which are actually not visible to simple visitors.

How do you list all these documents, so that you know which one to publish? Have you heard of a webpart that would help me to review and publish drafts?

It seems MS forgot to implement this feature (and there is no filter « does not end with »), which by the way is exactly how Sharepoint is made overall: there are some basics features, but anything that could actually boost your productivity is lacking.

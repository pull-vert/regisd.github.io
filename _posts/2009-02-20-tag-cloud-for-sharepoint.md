Tagging is a notable feature of web2.0 sites. The need for tagging is further increased in MS Sharepoint 2007, due to the new sites templates blog and wiki. 

I’m happy to announce that we have developed and released [Nuage](http://www.codeplex.com/nuage), a solution for Sharepoint that allows to tag elements and build a tag cloud.

There are already such solutions, such as [CKS](http://www.codeplex.com/CKS/Release/ProjectReleases.aspx?ReleaseId=4820), but we were disappointed by their performance when the number of elements scales. Also we wanted to build a tag cloud on the entire site collection, and this feature was not implemented in the solutions we tried.

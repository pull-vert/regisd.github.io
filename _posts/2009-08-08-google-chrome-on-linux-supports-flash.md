  The latest builds of Chrome has an experimental support of mozilla plugins. I now have flash :-)
  
  Google chrome is a very fast web browser, is lightweight, quick to start and innovating. However the linux version didn't support plugins. As such, Flash player was not support, and I had to choice but to stick on firefox/opera for browsing dailymotion, facebook games and so on.

Google chrome has been a major news in the web browser space. I couldnâ€™t help but to test it. Itâ€™s incredibly lightweight and fast, and brings a fair amount of innovations. I have been using it more and more since the latest version of firefox 3.5, which has disappointed me a lot &#8212; firefox is slow to start, and Iâ€™m pretty sure there are many holes for memory leaks.

  1. Install the latest build of chrome.
  2. Start chrome with the appropriate option
  
    `chrome --enable-plugins`

Oh by the way, Iâ€™ve made a quick script to easily install or upgrade chrome on linux

    #!/bin/sh
    DEST=/usr/local/google/chrome
    URL=http://dl.google.com/linux/direct/google-chrome-unstable_current_i386.deb
    tmp=$(mktemp -p /tmp -d)
    cd $tmp
    wget $URL
    ark -ba $(basename $URL)
    cd google-chrome-unstable_current_i386
    tar -xvf data.tar.lzma
    rm -rf $DEST
    mkdir -p $DEST
    mv opt/google/chrome/* $DEST
    cd
    rm -rf $tmp
    #Symlinks to required libraries
    ln -s /lib/libnspr4.so libnspr4.so.0d
    ln -s /lib/libnss3.so libnss3.so.1d
    ln -s /lib/libnssutil3.so libnssutil3.so.1d
    ln -s /usr/lib/libplc4.so libplc4.so.0d
    ln -s /lib/libplds4.so libplds4.so.0d
    ln -s /lib/libsmime3.so libsmime3.so.1d
    ln -s /lib/libssl3.so libssl3.so.1d
    
    

This script installs chromes in DEST=/usr/local/chrome

To start chrome: <tt>/usr/local/chrome/chrome --enable-plugins</tt>

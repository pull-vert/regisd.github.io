Do you remember my little firefox extension for firefox to interact with Blogmarks.net?

Well, now that [Google Chrome supports extensions](http://lifehacker.com/5405519/an-early-look-at-chromes-extensions-system) too (at least in the dev channel), Iâ€™m going to redevelop it for Chrome ðŸ™‚

My first impressions:

  * packaging the extension in chrome is much easier in Chrome (a Â«Â pack extension buttonÂ Â» versus many manipulations for firefox that I eventually scripted in an ant task)
  * the API is much more restrictive in Chrome than in Firefox

[Gizmodo](http://gizmodo.com/5488019/htc-legend-review-frankly-it-feels-expensive) was a true Oracle when they wrote:

> the home, menu, back and search keys did feel a bit cheap in comparison to the high-end feeling of the rest of the handset

I took my phone out of my pocket and discovered with horror that the « back » and « search » buttons were torn off.

They still work, though…; For how long?

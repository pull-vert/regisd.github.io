### Playing music on a computer

<span style="font-weight: normal;font-size: 13px">For Mac OS and Windows, I recommend <a title="Mozilla media player" href="http://getsongbird.com/">Songbird</a>. On Linux, I love </span>[Amarok](http://amarok.kde.org/ "KDE media player").

# <span style="font-weight: normal;font-size: 13px">I like to play music from my computer</span>

  * <span style="font-weight: normal;font-size: 13px">It’s more convenient to play music from the computer than inserting the CD in my hi-fi;</span>
  * <span style="font-weight: normal;font-size: 13px">It offers enhanced features, such as displaying the lyrics, artist bio, etc.;</span>
  * The software can build smart playlists from what has been played before;
  * <span style="font-weight: normal;font-size: 13px">Don’t worry, my <a title="Typical sound level is 18 dB" href="http://support.apple.com/kb/SP588">iMac is very silent</a>, and my hifi is plugged with an optical link.</span>

### What format to use?

But there are many ways to store Music on the computer:

  * Wav, Aiff, etc. are just wasting to much space, and do not handle tags (artist, album, track name, etc.)
  * MP3 is ubiquitous but severly impacts sound quality. However, I have bought several sounds on Amazon MP3 store, and I must keep this format.
  * Ogg is similar to MP3, it has a better compression but is less supported (shame on you, iTunes). I have downloaded sounds on Jamendo in this format.
  * Now, when storage is cheap, the best choice to rip CDs is to use a lossless encoding ; I know flac and Apple Lossless.

#### Flac

[Flac is the format I have used to rip my CDs](http://flac.sourceforge.net/ "Free Lossless Audio Codec") in the past couple of years.

  * It is open-source,
  * it is well supported: Extremely well supported on Linux, well supported on Windows, little support on Mac OS (but not in Apple iTunes)<sup><a href="#footnote_0_1446" id="identifier_0_1446" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Software supporting Flac">1</a></sup>
  * it supports tags;
  * it has very fast encoding;
  * if offers very fast decoding<sup><a href="#footnote_1_1446" id="identifier_1_1446" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Comparison of encoders and decoders">2</a></sup>;
  * from my experience, it is slightly (5%-10%) more compressed than Apple Lossless

#### Apple Lossless (Alac)

iTunes can rip CDs into « Apple Lossless ».

  * the format is proprietary;
  * Poor software support. Only works in iTunes;
  * Poor hardware support, only Apple devices can play it.
  * it supports tags.

### **For mobile play**

For mobile play, it is not necessary to have genuine sound quality, because small hear plugs can give a good sound anyway. Plus, memory space is rare precious.

That’s why, I re-encode my songs in [Ogg Vorbis](http://www.vorbis.com/ "Ogg Vorbis"), at 96 kbds VBR.

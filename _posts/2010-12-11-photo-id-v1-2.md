This new version has is a bug-fixe release

  * the menu has a link to the [Photo ID user guide](http://regis.decamps.info/blog/projects/photo-id-android/#userguide) hosted on this site
  * In the requirement screen the links to the government site are now clickable
  * Localization for UK and Canada (they actually didn’t work in the previous version, sorry)
  * photo sheet generation works for USA. In version 1.1, the size was NaN and these resulted in a blank sheet.

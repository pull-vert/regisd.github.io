If you have a smartphone, you are probably disappointed by the battery life. My HTC Legend can run for not more than one day.

Donncha O Caoimh, the author of WP-SuperCache, gives [a couple of tips to help reduce energy consumption](http://ocaoimh.ie/android-battery-saving-tips/). Changing the screen brightness is probably the first energy saver. Obviously turning on/off the Wifi, Bluetooth, 3G or even GSM, when needed is also a good tip. The [Dazzle widget](http://code.google.com/p/moonblink/wiki/Dazzle#Features) really helps to do that.

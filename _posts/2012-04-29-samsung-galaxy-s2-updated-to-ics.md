I have just updated my Samsung Galaxy SII to Android 4 (aka Ice cream sandwich).

I have used the official Kies application for Mac OS. Everything went smoothly after I fixed these two issues.

Problem: Kies doesn’t detect my device
  
I do Android development, and had turned on « USB debugging ». This n needs to be turned off.

Problem: Kies freezes when I click « update firmware »
  
It took me more time to find out why Kies froze every time I asked for updated. I eventually realized I log in Mac OS with an account that has no privileges, and discovered you need I had to use my administrative account.

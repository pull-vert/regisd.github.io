When I was working on SharePoint, I was shocked to see the gap between the rich marketing slides on one hand and the poor feature set on the other hand.

Apparently, this hasn’t changed, if I take a look at the number of blogs that promote Sharepoint but which are hosted on a better Web content management system (usually [WordPress](http://wordpress.org/))

  * http://blogs.technet.com/b/tothesharepoint/ NOT hosted on SarePoint
  * The Sharepoint guy http://blogs.msdn.com/b/uksharepoint/ NOT hosted on Sharepoint
  * Mastykarz Sharepoint MVP, hosted on WordPress
  * http://www.sharepointblog.co.uk/ hosted on WordPress
  * http://sharepointdragons.com/ powered by WordPress

People: eat your own food! Why don’t you do some WordPress consulting instead?
